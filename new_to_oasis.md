# New to Oasis?

This guide is meant to help get you started enjoying the greatest British rock band since The Beatles, no matter what your level of familiarity with their music and career.

The best place to start is by listening to the music.  This section outlines everything from studio releases to seminal live gigs, organized by era to help give you a true sense of what it was like to follow the band throughout its career.

### Greatest Hits / Compilations

### The “Biggest Band in the World” (1994-1997)

From the council estates of Manchester, UK to playing for 250,000 fans at Knebworth, this period contains many of the band’s most popular songs.  During this time, original drummer Tony McCarroll left the band and was replaced by Alan White during the recording of *(What's the Story) Morning Glory?*.

### The Hangover (1999-2000)

With every rise, there must eventually come a fall.  Oasis' came in the aftermath of *Be Here Now* and the death of Britpop, during a period in which Oasis lost nearly all that it once had. They lost their momentum, lost the two remaining non-Gallagher original members (Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs and Paul “Guigsy” McGuigan), ended their working relationship with Owen Morris, left Creation Records and, with the help of new producer Spike Stent (who'd previously worked with the Spice Girls, Madonna, and U2) changed their sound from the classic Oasis sound of the previous three albums into something much more akin to psychedelic rock. What came of it was an album which sounded very different to those that had come before, and which contained some of the most introspective and personal lyrics Noel has ever written.

### The “New Oasis” (2001-2009)

During this period, Gem Archer and Andy Bell joined the band to replace Guigsy and Bonehead and drummer Alan White left the band and was replaced by Ringo Starr's son, Zak Starkey (who would in turn be replaced by Chris Sharrock during their final tour).  It is characterized by increased contributions on the albums by other band members besides Noel Gallagher, including Liam, and new recruits Gem and Andy.  It ends with the break-up of the band in Paris on August 28, 2009.

### The B-Sides 

Unlike most bands, the b-sides of the singles released by Oasis (especially through the first four albums) could have easily been on the albums.  In fact, Oasis released an album of some of the more notable b-sides in 1998 called [The Masterplan](https://open.spotify.com/album/6tgQeTZ3893n3c3MvlPzi7).  As Noel Gallagher once declared in an interview, “I don't write shit songs!” This is a good place to start, but it is recommended to hunt down the rest.  In addition to the b-sides, be sure not to miss *Sad Song* and *Bonehead’s Bank Holiday*, which were originally included as extra tracks on *Definitely Maybe* (Japan) and *(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?* (UK vinyl only), respectively.  Both are included and the remastered deluxe versions of these original albums as well.

### Post-Oasis (2009-Present)

Following the breakup of Oasis in 2009, Noel Gallagher launched a solo career.  At the same time, the remaining members of Oasis (Liam Gallagher, Gem Archer, Andy Bell and Chris Sharrock) decided to continue under a new name, Beady Eye.  Beady Eye went on to release two albums, before disbanding in 2014 following a range of personal issues.  In 2017, Liam Gallagher released his first solo album, to much critical acclaim.  

As of 2018, Andy Bell is back with his first band Ride and Gem Archer and Chris Sharrock are currently touring with Noel Gallagher as part of his High Flying Birds.

## More

If you are feeling a bit like Noel Gallagher at the BRIT Awards in 1996 and still want more, here are a few suggestions.

**Dig into the bootlegs, unreleased tracks and demo recordings**

The internet is full of them.  Many of their gigs were recorded and exist as bootlegs.  There are also leaks of early demos and albums floating about.  The official re-releases of the first three albums include a lot of demos and outtakes as well.  To get started, it is recommended that you check out [Radio Supernova](https://radiosupernovablog.weebly.com) for demos, outtakes, collaborations and other hard-to-find material, as well as [The Right Ear of Nash](https://blonderazorblade.blogspot.com/search/label/Oasis) for remasters, live shows and other tasty items.
