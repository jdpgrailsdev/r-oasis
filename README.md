Copy of the style and content used for the [/r/oasis sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/oasis).

## Notes

* The mobile web sub logo can be set via the "old" Reddit "mobile look and feel" section.  See https://old.reddit.com/r/bannertestoasis/about/edit/.
* The mobile app banner and logo are set via the "new" Reddit Mod Tools banner settings (Mod Tools > Community Appearance > Banner > Mobile banner image and Mod Tools > Community Appearance > Name & Icon > Community Icon, respectively).  Note that this banner is only used for the mobile app.  The mobile website will use the main background banner set in the same menu.
